# Karma Tycoon: Tier System

The Tier system in Karma Tycoon represents your growth from a casual Redditor to a global media mogul. Each tier unlocks new subreddits and upgrades, scaling exponentially in both cost and power.

## Progression Logic

Tiers are unlocked based on your **Lifetime Karma**. Even if you spend your Karma on upgrades or subreddits, your progress toward the next tier continues to grow.

| 3 | Viral Growth | 10,000 | Events, trending topics, and engagement. |
| 4 | Platform Dominance | 100,000 | Global influence and algorithm manipulation. |
