# Karma Tycoon: Tier System

The Tier system in Karma Tycoon represents your growth from a casual Redditor to a global media mogul. Each tier unlocks new subreddits and upgrades, scaling exponentially in both cost and power.

## Progression Logic

Tiers are unlocked based on your **Lifetime Karma**. Even if you spend your Karma on upgrades or subreddits, your progress toward the next tier continues to grow.

| Tier | Name | Lifetime Karma | Max Energy | Recharge | Click Power | Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | The Basics | 0 | 50 | 1s | 1x | Initial growth and click power. |
| 2 | Community Mgmt | 1,000 | 30 | 10s | 15x | Efficiency and basic automation. |
| 3 | Viral Growth | 10,000 | 15 | 1m | 200x | Events and engagement. |
| 4 | Platform Dom. | 100,000 | 5 | 5m | 3,000x | Global influence. |
| 5 | The Front Page | 1,000,000 | 1 | 20m | 50,000x | End-game scaling. |
