This document outlines the planned evolution of Karma Tycoon beyond the initial MVP, categorized into Minor (feature polish) and Major (mechanic overhaul) releases.

---

## 🟢 v1.x: The "Engagement" Era (Minor Updates)
*Focus: Enhancing the core loop and providing more immediate feedback.*

### v1.1: Reddit Awards & Buffs
- **Mechanic**: Users can earn/buy "Silver", "Gold", and "Platinum" awards.
- **Impact**: Awards act as temporary multipliers (e.g., Gold gives 5x Karma for 5 minutes).
- **Visuals**: Shiny particle effects and award icons appearing on subreddit cards.

### v1.2: Advanced Analytics & Achievements
- **Mechanic**: Detailed charts showing Karma-per-second (KPS) trends.
- **Impact**: A 50+ item achievement list (e.g., "First 1M Subs", "Drama Queen", "Speedposter") that provides small permanent bonuses.

## 🔵 v2.0: The "Prestige" Update (Major Milestone)
*Focus: Long-term replayability and progression depth.*

### v2.0: Subreddit Rebranding (Prestige System)
- **New Mechanic**: When hitting a massive karma milestone, players can "Rebrand" their empire.
- **Consequence**: Resets all subreddits and current karma.
- **Reward**: Earn "Reddit Coins" (permanent currency) used to buy "Legendary Mods" or "Algorithm Access" that provide massive global multipliers for the next run.

### v2.1: Seasonal Challenges
- **Mechanic**: Monthly themes (e.g., "Holiday Meme War").
- **Impact**: Unique subreddits and upgrades only available during the season.

## 🟡 v3.0: The "Algorithm" Update (Major Milestone)
*Focus: Strategic complexity and world-building.*

### v3.0: Gaming the Algorithm
- **New Mechanic**: The "Global Sentiment" meter. Users must balance their posts between "Low Effort Memes" and "High Quality OC".
- **Complexity**: The "Algorithm" changes its preference every few hours. If you align your subreddits with the current meta, your KPS skyrockets; if not, it stagnates.
- **Rivals**: AI-controlled "Corporate Accounts" that try to buy out your subreddits or "Brigade" your growth.

### v3.1: Custom Communities
- **Mechanic**: Player-created subreddits with custom names and icons.
- **Impact**: Players can "Export" their subreddit stats as shareable cards for social media virality.

---

## 🔴 v4.0: The "Network" Update (Major Milestone)
*Focus: Social interaction and meta-play.*

### v4.0: The Front Page (Asynchronous Multiplayer)
- **New Mechanic**: A global "Front Page" where the top players' subreddits are displayed.
- **Interaction**: Players can "Upvote" or "Downvote" other players on the leaderboard, affecting their passive growth rates slightly.
- **Alliances**: Create "Multireddits" (clans/guilds) to compete in weekly karma races.
